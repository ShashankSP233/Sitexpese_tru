/**
 * Wipes TRIAL/TRANSACTIONAL data only -- vouchers, evidence, queries, funds,
 * audit log, and history. Leaves your real setup untouched: user accounts,
 * projects, categories, and locations are NOT touched.
 *
 * Use this (not a full database wipe) once real projects/users exist that
 * you don't want to lose -- e.g. renamed projects, real site accounts.
 *
 * Deletes:
 *   - every row in: expenses, evidence, expense_history, funds,
 *     queries, query_messages, audit
 *   - every uploaded evidence file in uploads/ that belonged to a deleted voucher
 *   - resets the voucher number counter back to 1000 (next voucher: VCH-1001)
 *
 * Keeps completely untouched:
 *   - users, user_projects -- every account, password, role, project access
 *   - projects, categories, locations -- your Masters setup
 *
 * Uses the same DATABASE_URL as the app. IMPORTANT: stop the server first.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run reset-data
